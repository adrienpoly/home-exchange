Much larger shop, very famous in Bordeaux for their aggressive pricing and top quality.

## Wine

Next to our home we have several options to buy wine

⛔ **La maison Désirée**

They have the largest collection of Whisky in Bordeaux. Buying Spirit is the only reason to enter this shop. WE DON’T RECOMMEND BUYING WINE FROM THEM. Usually much more expensive for nothing special.

**Les fromages de Manon**
She has a narrow but good selection of Bordeaux wines and other regions

**La Cave à Part**

11 Cr Gambetta, 33400 Talence (1km)

Martin will talk to you endlessly about each bottle. He has a very special selection of boutique vineyards. While he has a few bottles from Bordeaux he specializes in wines from other regions too.

**Caves Saint Genès**
8 Bis Rue Edmond Costedoat, 33000 Bordeaux (1km)
Small wine shop with a good selection of Bordeaux wines

## Pastries

**Pâtisserie S.**
[https://www.satomiandstanley.com/](https://www.satomiandstanley.com/)
8 Cr d'Alsace-et-Lorraine, 33000 Bordeaux

This is our preferred place for cakes. It is a Japanese couple who work in top French restaurants. The result is excellent.
