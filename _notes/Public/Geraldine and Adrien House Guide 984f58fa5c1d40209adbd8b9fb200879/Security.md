Bordeaux is usually a very safe place. As always as tourists be careful for pickpockets.

Our neighborhood is also very safe, still, we recommend you close the doors when you are inside. You can also use the interphone if someone rings. From time to time people might ring at the door asking for services or money but this is very rare.
