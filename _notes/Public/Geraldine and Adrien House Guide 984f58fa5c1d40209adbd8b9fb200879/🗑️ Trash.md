## Compost

You can put organic trash in the compost at the back of the garden. This will help us grow vegetables next summer. Bellow the sink we have a dedicated trash for the compost.

## Packagings/ Recycling

Paper, cardboard, metal. All kinds of recyclable packaging.

This goes to the green trash outside. They are collected every Wednesday morning.

## Glass
