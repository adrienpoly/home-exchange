We have a few bicycles quite Vintage as you can see. Perfect to navigate in the city. Probably not for long distance.

Bikes are located in the garage at the number 71. Keys for the garage is at the entrance (pink key holder)

<aside>
⛔ The door inside the garage goes to a small studio. This studio is rented to a student. She is very quiet and serious. The studio is not part of the exchange and remains a private property. Also if you store additional bikes in the garage the access to the studio door must be preserved.

<aside>
⚠️ Lots of bikes are stollen in Bordeaux unfortunately. Always lock the bikes when you leave them somewhere. We have one lock with code.  The code is 69696.

## Renting bikes

Here are two shops to rent bikes that we would recommend (we never rented from them just network recommendations)

**Paulette**

**Esprit cycle**

The first one is at a walking distance from the house the second is right in the center 20min walking or direct bus (4)

## Trip ideas

Here is a map of provided by the city of Bordeaux **[Super balades à vélo 2020](https://www.bordeaux-metropole.fr/content/download/102972/1265159/version/5/file/Superbalade_a_Velo_04-2020.pdf) (FR)**

#1 is a very nice classic

you can do it like that or with a very nice variation is to take the track in the direction of Toulouse at point 11 on the map. This bike track will take you to the wine region call `Entre deux mers` (between two seas) as it is named like that as it is between the Garonne and Dordogne rivers.

#7 can be combined with #1 and/or combined with a visit to Darwin Eco System (must see in Bordeaux if you like street are and creative places)

The track to go to Lacanau is very famous yet it is about 60km so 120 round trip….

## Some other ideas

### Going to the Ocean

You can take the train with your bike either from the central station or from Pessac center. There is a train going to Arcachon almost every 30min (depending on the hour of the day). 

**Then from Arcachon several options are available:**

1. take the boat to cross the bassin an go to the Cap Ferret. Cap Ferret is a paradise for bikes (and hell for cars during summer). Perfect place to eat oysters. Things to see are the oysters village in the Bassin especially l’Herbe, le canon. Walk at the tip of the cap from the bassin side to the ocean (Plage de l’horizon)

1. Tour the beautiful villas in the Ville d’hiver, Go south climb the Pila dune (this is a must see), then reach ocean beaches (petit nice) you can go up to Biscaross (Lake or ocean). We haven’t visited this place recently. This summer there has been huge fires in this region. It might look very strange ???? especially the road between Arcachon and Biscaross was very impacted.

Boat tours are also available on the bassin you can google for various options not sure this time of the year what remains open

## Going to St Emillion

This is a very famous wine region. The village is beautiful and something to see in Bordeaux. From there you can easy tour in bikes within the wineyards (slightly up and down…). If you want to visit a chateau you can ask at the village in tourist center what are the options (they change every day I think).

Example of a little tour [https://www.gironde-tourisme.fr/itineraires/boucle-velo-la-route-des-vins-famille/](https://www.gironde-tourisme.fr/itineraires/boucle-velo-la-route-des-vins-famille/)

Might be a ride to go directly from Bordeaux to St Emillion. Once again an alternative is to take the train to Libourne (from the central station)
