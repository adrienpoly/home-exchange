Current setting is 19° during the day and 18° during the night as per the current state recommendations but we can easily change that if needed.

## Fire stove

Given the weather we didn’t really prepare it but just in case the weather really change they are wood and fire starter available next to it. To init the fire open the door at the very bottom to get a strong air intake during the ignition. Once it is started close this door otherwise the heat goes directly out in the chimney.
