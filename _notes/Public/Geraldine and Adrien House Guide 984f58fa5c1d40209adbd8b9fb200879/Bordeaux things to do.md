Don’t hesitate to ask us questions they are many things to do for every tastes and it is hard for us to list everything. This being said here are a few things that we particularly like.

## Historical center

Walk within the historical center with lots of pedestrians road. 

- Place Pey Berland
- Porte Cailhau
- Opera
- Place Quinconces
- Place des grands hommes

Given the weather those places will be very busy at night with lots of terrasse.

The main active places at night are around Place Camille Julian and Place Fernand Lafargue

## Saint Michel / Capucins

This is one of our favorite district in Bordeaux. Saint Michel used to be an arabic district and antique shops. It is now a very popular district in Bordeaux with lots of activity on the main place. It is nice also to walk around in the small streets in quartier St Croix. Between St Michel and the Train Station.

There is a famous flea market every Sunday morning

### Darwin

If you like street art, skating and creativity this is a place to visit. 

The restaurant inside is an excellent place to stop if you are nearby. On Sunday they have a brunch (a bit more pricey). Reservations are recommended for brunch.

### Museum

Museau are free the first Sunday of each month

- CAPC : modern art museum. As with all modern art museums, the exhibition can be a hit or miss… but the building by itself is really worth a visit [https://www.capc-bordeaux.fr/actuellement](https://www.capc-bordeaux.fr/actuellement)
- MECA : [https://fracnouvelleaquitaine-meca.fr/agenda/](https://fracnouvelleaquitaine-meca.fr/agenda/)
