We have two cats that you cannot miss during your stay

## 🐼 Mimi Panda

She is now quite old and doesn’t do much except sleeping and eating. We have been trying for years to put her on a diet with no luck at all!

### Rules

She is unable to use the cat door anymore and her toilets are in the garden. 

Recently she became a bit dirty when staying inside the house too long.

**Therefore**

- During the day she goes out
- Whenever you are out of the home she is out of the home in the garden.
- She can sleep outside or inside (as long as she is outside early in the morning)

### Food

There is a pot in the kitchen (Black cat) with her food. 

You can find extra cat food below the toaster in the kitchen.

**Tip:** don’t forget to give her some food before going to sleep otherwise she will wake you up early in the morning.

🚰 Please fill cups of water daily outside in addition to the water fountain

## 🐩 Djette

All white, still looking like a baby cat (she is 2) as fast as the light. She spends her days in and out of the house using the cat door (or entering from the balcony)

😻 She love getting some fresh water from the tab or directly in your glass

😻 She usually sleep in the living room on a white fur or nearby us

### Food

No restriction. We feed her in a small cup on the counter top historically so that Mimi would not eat her food when we tried to restrict a bit the daily quantity.
